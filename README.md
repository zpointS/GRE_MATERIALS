Wish that you have a good journey towards computer science and artificial intelligence! As nowadays the large language models (LLMs) are thriving, it may be a good idea for us to leverage this kind of natural language processing tools to help us improve our english competence. A good idea might be directly using LLMs like Chatgpt or GPT-4, and guide them to be a tutor for you. Or you can leverage python, pytorch and huggingface or chatgpt-api to make your own tutor even offline! This could be very amazing as an application of artificial intelligence, where hands-on experience can be gained! But I haven't tried it yet, and the reason why I write so much is because I want to make this repo be detected as an AI-related repo, AI-application-related repo. Thanks!
